I'm a Ph.D. student in [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by Prof. [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [ACM Honor Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my senior year, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/) at University of Washington.

My research interests lie in building effient system support for AI applications, drawing insights from both system and algorithm sides.
